A dropdown menubutton that

  - is a React component;
  - follows [the WAI-ARIA Menu Button Design Pattern](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton) for maximal accessibility;
  - uses [SUIT CSS conventions](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/README.md) for maximal themeability;
  - is very thoroughly tested.

Have a look around.
